# SMG
This repository contains the Python implementation of the SMG model, the baseline models and the generated data introduced in the 2021 paper "Sensorimotor Graph: Action-Conditioned Relational Forward ModelLearning of Robotic Soft Hand Dynamics" (submitted to the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)).

The SMG model is adapted from the [Neural Relational Inference](https://github.com/ethanfetaya/NRI), as well as some of the baseline models. The data corresponds to the 3-D movement of a non-rigid  three-joint soft hand-inspired gripper and was generated using SOFA and Soft Robotics Toolkit.
